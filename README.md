Easycheck is a lightweight HTTP server designed to monitor and report the status of the server it operates on. It
achieves this by offering a single endpoint that users can query to check the serverâ€™s health.

### How does it work?

1. Periodic Checks: Easycheck performs regular checks on specific services, such as an HTTP endpoint or a TCP socket,
   running on the host system.
2. Determining Availability: If any of these checks fail, Easycheck marks the server as "unavailable." Consequently,
   when the endpoint is queried, the server responds with a status code "503" (Service Unavailable).
3. Successful Checks: If all checks pass, the server is considered healthy, and the endpoint returns the status code
   "200" (OK).
4. Maintenance Override: You can manually override the checks by creating a special maintenance file. When this file is
   present, the server will always be reported as "unavailable," regardless of the actual check results.

This setup ensures that the server is monitored and can be marked as unavailable in case a backend service is no longer
responding, for example, in a load balancer.

### Configuration

Easycheck can be configured with command line parameters or environment variables.

| Command Line Option         | Environment Variable                | Required | Default              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Format: `ip:port` (or for ipv6 addresses: `[ip]:port`                                                                                                                                             |
| `--revalidation-interval`   | `EASYCHECK_REVALIDATE_INTERVAL`     | No       | 5                    | The interval between check executions in seconds. Must be positive.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `--force-success-file-path` | `EASYCHECK_FORCE_SUCCESS_FILE_PATH` | No       | `easycheck.success`  | Defines the path where the force-success file is located. If this file exists the service is marked as available even if some checks failed.                                                                                                |
| `--mtc-file-path`           | `EASYCHECK_MTC_FILE_PATH`           | No       | `easycheck.disabled` | Defines the path where the maintenance file is located. Can be an absolute or relative path.                                                                                                                                                |

Easycheck connects to the socket, sends a `QUIT` message and tries to receive a response. The check if successful if the connection succeeds and a response is received. |
